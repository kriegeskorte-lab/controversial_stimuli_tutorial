# **Synthesizing Controversial Stimuli (a tutorial with PyTorch)**

This is a tutorial on how to generate controversial stimuli for ImageNet classifiers using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). More details on the method of controversial stimuli can be found in our [paper](https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912334117):

T. Golan, P. C. Raju, N. Kriegeskorte, Controversial stimuli: Pitting neural networks against each other as models of human cognition. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117, 29330â€“29337 (2020). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1912334117

The tutorial is contained in a Jupyter notebook:\
[Synthesizing_Controversial_Stimuli_Tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/kriegeskorte-lab/controversial_stimuli_tutorial/blob/main/Synthesizing_Controversial_Stimuli_Tutorial.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kriegeskorte-lab/controversial_stimuli_tutorial/blob/main/Synthesizing_Controversial_Stimuli_Tutorial.ipynb) [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kriegeskorte-lab/controversial_stimuli_tutorial/blob/main/Synthesizing_Controversial_Stimuli_Tutorial.ipynb)

#### Installation:
If you want to run the notebook or the Python code on your own machine (i.e., not on Google Colab), you would have to install the dependencies.

Start with creating a conda environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/kriegeskorte-lab/controversial_stimuli_tutorial
cd controversial_stimuli_tutorial
conda create -n contro_stim_env python==3.11
conda activate contro_stim_env
```

Proceed with installing PyTorch according to the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This code was tested on PyTorch 1.6 to 2.1.2, and Kornia 0.4.1 to 0.7.1.

Next, install the remaining dependencies:

```
conda install pytables
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to run the notebook, you would also need to install JupyterLab:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
jupyter lab Synthesizing_Controversial_Stimuli_Tutorial.ipynb
```
#### Batch stimulus synthesis
This repository also includes Python code for synthesizing controversial stimuli in a batch.
After installing the dependencies, you can synthesize all of the images that appear in the figure above by running:
```
python batch_optimize.py --experiments cat_vs_dog --optimization_methods CPPN --max_steps=1000
```
To synthesize all of the images that appear in the tutorial figures, run `python batch_optimize.py` without arguments (warning: this takes many hours if not done over a GPU cluster). This code is compatible with being run by multiple workers in parallel (it synchronizes tasks through 0-byte file flags). However, let a single worker run alone for a couple of minutes so it can download the necessary DNNs without competition.
